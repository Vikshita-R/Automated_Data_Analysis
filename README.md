# Automated Data Analysis


## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to **automate the most common steps in data analysis**, such as:
- Loading and cleaning datasets
- Generating visualizations
- Identifying correlations
- Presenting results in a clear and visual manner

---

## Datasets Analyzed

We applied this tool to three real-world datasets:

### 1. Goodreads Ratings
Analyzed user ratings of books to find rating distributions and relationships between book attributes.

### 2. World Happiness Index
Explored country-level data to identify what factors are most correlated with happiness scores.

### 3. Media Consumption
Investigated how people consume different forms of media and how they might relate to other social indicators.
